## R Markdown

This is an **R Markdown** document. In a code chunk make a data frame from the air quality dataset. In the same chunk clean the dataset from NA values. Knit the *RMarkdown* file and make a PDF file:

```
airquality[1:6,]
good <- complete.cases(airquality)
good
airquality[good,][1:6,]
```
